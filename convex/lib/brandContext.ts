export const BRAND_CONTEXT = `## 2nd Summit Brand Context

**Name**: 2nd Summit (not "Second Summit", not "2ndSummit")
**Tagline**: "Your Hub for What's Next"
**Mission**: A community hub of highly curated experiences that promote physical activity, mental engagement, and social connection — for people in their next chapter of life.
**Location**: Denver, CO

### Target Audience
People in their "next chapter of life" — empty nesters, recent retirees, career transitioners, anyone whose routines have shifted. They value meaning over novelty, quality over quantity, genuine connection over networking. They are NOT looking for extreme adventure, high-pressure fitness, or age-segregated "senior" activities.

### Three Pillars
- **Move** — Physical activity, casual to adventurous, "meet people where they are, without pressure or performance expectations"
- **Discover** — Mental engagement through conversation, culture, creative exploration, hands-on discovery
- **Connect** — Shared interests creating space for real conversation, familiar faces, naturally meeting new people

### Brand Voice
- Warm but not saccharine — invitational, never pushy
- Confident but humble — knows its value, doesn't oversell
- Inclusive, low-pressure — "meet people where they are"
- Active and forward-looking — "what's next," "spark"
- Never patronizing — does not talk down to the audience or frame aging negatively

### Event Discovery Guidelines
- Events should feel like invitations from a friend, not marketing campaigns
- Focus on experiences that are casual, approachable, and well-designed
- DO include: community events, group activities, classes, workshops, outdoor adventures, cultural outings, social gatherings
- DO NOT include: events specifically marketed as "senior" activities, high-intensity competitive events, events requiring advanced skills unless noted
- Key phrases: "highly curated experiences," "staying active, curious, and connected," "simple, well-designed gatherings"`;
