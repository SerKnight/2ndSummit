# 2nd Summit BRAND.md Copywriting Reference

## What We Know

2nd Summit is a Denver-based community brand with a single-page site at [2ndsummit.org](https://2ndsummit.org). It positions itself as a **community hub of curated experiences** for people in their "next chapter of life." The brand currently has one upcoming event (Flames & Frames at Punch Bowl Social, Denver).

## Proposed BRAND.md Structure

The file will be created at `/Users/serknight/code/2ndsummit/BRAND.md` with the following sections:

### 1. Brand Overview

- **Name**: 2nd Summit (not "Second Summit", not "2ndSummit")
- **Tagline**: "Your Hub for What's Next"
- **One-liner mission**: A community hub of highly curated experiences that promote physical activity, mental engagement, and social connection -- for people in their next chapter of life.
- **Domain**: 2ndsummit.org
- **Location**: Denver, CO

### 2. Brand Story & Purpose

- Why it exists: As routines change and priorities shift, it becomes harder to find meaningful, enjoyable experiences. 2nd Summit makes discovering those experiences easier.
- What "2nd Summit" means: The metaphor of a second peak -- not winding down, but ascending again. A new chapter, not the last one.
- Core belief: Staying active, curious, and connected matters most in this stage of life.

### 3. Target Audience

- People in their "next chapter of life" -- empty nesters, recent retirees, career transitioners, anyone whose routines have shifted
- They value: meaning over novelty, quality over quantity, genuine connection over networking
- They are not looking for: extreme adventure, high-pressure fitness, or age-segregated "senior" activities

### 4. Three Brand Pillars

Each pillar with its definition and copywriting guardrails:

- **Move** -- Physical activity, casual to adventurous, "meet people where they are, without pressure or performance expectations"
- **Discover** -- Mental engagement through conversation, culture, creative exploration, hands-on discovery
- **Connect** -- Shared interests creating space for real conversation, familiar faces, naturally meeting new people

### 5. Brand Voice & Tone

Derived from analyzing the existing site copy:

- **Warm but not saccharine** -- invitational, never pushy
- **Confident but humble** -- knows its value, doesn't oversell
- **Inclusive, low-pressure** -- phrases like "meet people where they are," "without pressure or performance expectations," "just occasional updates, no spam"
- **Active and forward-looking** -- "what's next," "spark," "stay in the loop"
- **Human and conversational** -- uses em dashes, sentence fragments for rhythm, avoids corporate jargon
- **Never patronizing** -- does not talk down to the audience or frame aging negatively; "next chapter" not "getting older"

### 6. Messaging Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use "next chapter," "what's next," "curated," "gather/gathering," "spark," "thoughtfully designed"
- **Do**: Frame experiences as casual, approachable, well-designed
- **Don't**: Use "senior," "elderly," "aging," "retirement community," or anything that defines people by age
- **Don't**: Overpromise ("life-changing," "transformative") -- keep it grounded
- **Don't**: Use high-pressure sales language or urgency tactics

### 7. Copy Patterns & Recurring Phrases

- Key phrases pulled directly from the site that define the brand lexicon:
  - "highly curated experiences"
  - "staying active, curious, and connected"
  - "meaningful and enjoyable"
  - "simple, well-designed gatherings"
  - "spark movement, conversation, and connection"
  - "meet people where they are"
  - "without pressure or performance expectations"
  - "real conversation, familiar faces"
  - "naturally meet new people along the way"

### 8. Event Copy Guidelines

- Events should feel like invitations from a friend, not marketing campaigns
- Pattern from Flames & Frames: casual descriptor + what to expect + hosted by 2nd Summit
- Include practical details (time, place, what to do on arrival) in a warm, direct tone
- Example: "Join us for a casual evening of bowling, fun food, cocktails and a glimpse into what 2nd Summit is all about."

### 9. Email / CTA Guidelines

- CTAs should be soft and invitational: "Stay in the Loop," "Save Your Spot"
- Always set expectations: "Just occasional updates. No spam."
- Respect the audience's autonomy and time

## Implementation Notes

- This is a **net-new file** in an empty repo -- no existing files to modify
- Written in Markdown for easy reference by both humans and AI tools
- Designed to be the canonical copywriting reference that can be pointed to in any future content task
